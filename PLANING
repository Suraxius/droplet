What it does:
  Store files across the world on nodes in equaliy sized chunks and allows the downloading of these chunks by other nodes.
  Node - A Client that runs on a users device and facilitates the upload, access, and download of chunks.

Requirements: 
  Decentralized storage of chunks.
  Downloading of chunks by each node.
  Building of circuits of multiple nodes in between sender and receiver to provide privacy.
  Each node caches requested chunks once they pass through.
  The file name, size, etc. and chunk checksums get stored in a .dro file that works similar to a torrent file.

Restrictions:
  A Node can not explicitly upload chunks but rather seeds chunks until they get requested. Other nodes will then cache the chunks and upload is done.
  Nodes must never store any sort of metadata about an uploaded file. Metadata about chunks is ok.
  Caching is done by popularity. The more popular a chunk, the longer it gets retained.

DRO File
  The filesize of a dro file for a 10GB file with chunk size of 1MB and using sha512 for checksumming
  the dro file size uncompressed is about 1.3MB just with checksums and 658KB when compressed with xz at full compression.
  This is the file size in ascii format so might be smaller as binary.
